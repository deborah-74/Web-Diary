  <h2 class="title">Under my skin</h2>
  <p class="prose1">I wish my skin was a jacket I could just zip open after a long<br>day of work and toss carelessly to the edge<br>of my bed as I snuggled the rest<br>of me into my blanket. That way, I could choose<br>a new skin to wear each day. I could discard my old,<br>bruised skins without a worry, and begin a new day<br>as a new me.</p>
<p class="prose1">Or what if I had no skin at all?<br>Like a peeled banana.<br>I could walk around town a bloody, mushy lump of flesh,<br>concealing thin tubes pumping<br>red fluid into every crevasse<br>of my body. And everyone would be<br>too scared to touch me.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="boxP1" class="boxP2">
    <h2 class="title">Self-Diagnosis</h2>
    <p class="prose1">Clouds of imagination condense and<br>precipitate in my head. Gravity tugs the<br>creative droplets downwards and they trickle<br>down the back of my throat and meander<br>across the curve of my right shoulder. They<br>drip through my veins and accelerate towards<br>the tip of my fingers and then they<br>stop. My scorching skin boils the droplets<br>until they evaporate. And then just like that,<br>they dissipate. The piece of paper is as dry as<br>it was when I first picked it up. I think<br>I am broken.</p>
  <p class="prose1">Or what if I had no skin at all?<br>Like a peeled banana.<br>I could walk around town a bloody, mushy lump of flesh,<br>concealing thin tubes pumping<br>red fluid into every crevasse<br>of my body. And everyone would be<br>too scared to touch me.</p>

      <h2 class="title">Love Poem</h2>
      <p class="prose1">Love is a mug of hot chocolate<br>on a cold and stormy night.<br>Its warmth swaddles you like<br>a mother wrapping her<br>new-born baby in her gentle embrace.<br>Its sweetness is euphoric,<br>protecting you from the thunderous<br>rain outside. But sometimes it can be<br>sickening. And scorch your upper lip<br>as you try to take a sip. And if you don’t<br>take care as you place the mug<br>down on your bedside table, it may<br>spill all over. Or worse, shatter,<br>leaving you to pick up the jagged shards. All alone.</p>

      <div id="boxP1" class="boxP4">
        <h2 class="title">Mr Medusa</h2>
        <p class="prose1">You had a magic touch.<br>You’d twirl and snap and prod<br>until I turned into stone. Then you’d<br>chisel me away, chip by chip, until I was<br>smoothed to your liking. Once you were done<br>fiddling, you’d toss me away and then I’d<br>shatter into jagged shards, hurting none other but<br>myself. At night, I’d glue myself back together with my tears.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="boxP1" class="boxP5">
          <h2 class="title">Mother Knows Best</h2>
          <p class="prose1">you fell from the sky<br>trapped in a stone hard shell<br>that grimy old thing<br>i’m sure you don’t miss it one bit<br>it was sealed shut<br>but my tears cracked it open<br>and then a thousand lights burst through<br>yellow and sparkling like your hair<br>you see that sun?<br>it shines for you</p>
        <p class="prose1">your little heart was broken<br>black like coal and fading by the second<br>you poor thing<br>aren’t you glad i found you<br>your skin was scaly and peeling<br>your blood dark and seething<br>but i whisked you away<br>inside where it is safe and cosy<br>and then your heart turned gold<br>and magic filled your veins<br>you see this house?<br>its built for you</p>
        <p class="prose1">you couldn’t stop crying<br>your shriek could deafen the wildest crow<br>you lucky girl<br>you were in so much pain weren’t you<br>your throat was throbbing<br>and your eyes were flooding<br>but then i sang you a sweet bird’s song<br>and then i wrapped you in my arms<br>you held onto me for your dear life<br>and asked me to never let go<br>you hear my heart?<br>it beats for you</p>
