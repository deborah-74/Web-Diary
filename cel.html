                <p>
                    You remember going on a walk the previous night and then everything went black...then suddenly, you're awake and alone in a dark forest. The sky has a green tint, and the brightest star you've ever seen shines right above your head. Are you still on Earth? Are you dreaming? Who knows? You are standing at the foot of a large door made of three mossy, concrete blocks. In front of you, there's a fire, engulfing a horde of bones, whoich are yellow from rotting. You can hear crows, and a choir singing a very ominous hymn. Further down there is a large amphitheatre, but every seat is untouched. You can also hear whispers, but there is no life in sight. Only death. Behind you, there is a large cave, lit by blood red crystals. You are the only sign of life, but not for much longer...

                <h3 class="title1">About Celessodhia</h3>
                <p>
                    Celessodhia is a post-apocalyptic world where technology and humans have destroyed the world. Radiation has gotten rid of life, and the air is unbreathable. However, there is one piece of land unaffected by the destruction that exists in the rest of the world. This land was named Celessodhia, after their god, Celeste. The people who live here do not use any technology - it is banned. They worship Celeste and do not see themselves as having dominion over the Earth, as their ancestors believed. They live in peace. However, whenever anyone commits a sin - theft, murder, poaching etc - they must be burnt alive for redemption. Celessodhians believe that when you are consumed by fire, your soul rises to be with Celeste for eternity. So they do not see this as a punishment. They see it as a sacred ritual - a blessing, in fact. The ritual is called The Ascension Ceremony. It takes place in an amphitheatre near the periphery of Celessodhia. This is why the sky is green and there are no animals around but crows. They cannot survive the radiation. The scene of this particular space is an ascension ceremony, where you are about to be burnt alive for your own sins.

                <p>
                    1) I started with a large plane which I moulded with polybrush to achieve my intended texture
                </p>
                <p>
                    2) Then I moulded an arch to create a cave, which is a key part of Celessodhia - the cave of whispers!
                </p>
                <div class="artPics3">
                    <img src="cel2.png" width="100%" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    3) I downloaded a grass material and a skybox which fit the atmosphere I wanted to create, and added it to the project
                </p>
                <p>
                    4) Next, I began constructing the amphitheatre, where the ascension ceremony would be taking place. I used a variety of 3D shapes to get the construction right. Then, I downloaded materials for the different parts of the theatre
                </p>
                <p>
                    5) I built the stage, which I wanted to be filled with bones, skulls and wood. I added a plane with a gravel material to give it a distinct look
                </p>
                <p>
                    6) I downloaded assets - trees, wooden sheds, a well, rocks, fences - to bring the setting to life!
                </p>
                <div class="artPics3">
                    <img src="cel7.png" width="100%" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    7) I also constructed a doorway made with cubes
                </p>
                <p>
                    8) I used a 2m capsule as a reference to the human body throughout, in order to help with sizing objects
                </p>
                <p>
                    9) I downloaded crystal assets and altered their look to fit the vibe I wanted
                </p>
                <p>
                    10) I used a particle system and lighting to create fire
                </p>
                <div class="artPics3">
                    <img src="cel4.png" width="100%" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    11) I also added red spot lights to the cave
                </p>
                <p>
                    12) I created a script that would rotate the skybox
                </p>
                <div class="artPics3">
                    <img src="cel9.png" width="100%" />
                </div>
                <p class="num5">
                    13) I added sounds - a choir singing a hymn, whisper sounds, crow sounds and fire sounds
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3 class="title1">How to Improve My Project</h3>
                <p>
                    To improve my project, I will take advantage of the sounds and scripting them so that they would only play when a certain action is done, such as when an object is in view. I would also make more use of environmental storytelling, to suggest that people had visited that particle place not too long ago. Perhaps I would scatter some human objects around, or objects that hint at what sin the user themselves committed. But overall, I am pleased with my project as I learnt a lot about Unity and how to create imersive storytelling!
