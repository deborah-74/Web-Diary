  <h2 class="title">Excerpt from Celessodhia</h2>
  <p class="prose1">The sweet smell of honeysuckle invaded the air, and it was intoxicating. For every gust of honeyed breeze that tickled Sister Camellia’s nose, she was filled with faint optimism that waiting for her at the end of this journey was at the very least, decent news. Perhaps today is different, she thought. Of course, the past few gatherings at the amphitheatre were nothing short of a horrifying sight, but that does not certify the terror of future gatherings. A sharp forwards jolt of the horsecart followed by a strained whinny put an immediate end to her trance.</p>
    <p class="prose1">The sun was a red gold nectarine, its bittersweet juices setting the sky ablaze. Camellia stuck her nose out of the window and glued her eyes to it. The stony houses. The blossom fields. The towering trees. They all shifted as the horses trotted along the streets of Founder’s Oak, vanishing and then reappearing and again and again. But the sun was unyielding. She wished to be like the sun.</p>
<p class="prose1">“I suspect Lord Elwood will be leading another Ascension Ceremony”, Sister Prunella whispered impatiently, her round chin buried into her collar bone. Camellia’s eyes darted towards Prunella’s face briefly. She hoped that would not be the case.</p>
  <p class="prose1">“Perhaps a Rite of Good Fortune? We’ve not had a fruitful harvest in two moons”, Sister Dahlia muttered in response, not discreet enough to stop a dozen vexed glances coming her way. They had been instructed not to speak about the current drop in yield, so as to avoid unnecessary worry.</p>
  <p class="prose1">“Sister Dahlia!”, one of the Disciples shrieked from the front of the horsecart, which prompted the remaining girls to shake their heads in disappointment, a bunch of heads swaying back and forth like a morning bell. Camellia joined in too. At the ripe age of seventeen, she had mastered the art of conformity.</p>
  <p class="prose1">The journey came to a halt and soon each tier of seats in the amphitheatre was occupied with eager Celessodhians awaiting their Lord’s announcement. In the front rows sat the Elders, who were all donning virtuous profiles, their noses hoisted upwards as though the higher its position, the more righteous. Behind them were the Matrons, followed by the Disciples, of whom Camellia sat amongst comfortably. The last few rows were taken by some townsfolk who had travelled from beyond Founder’s Oak to give ear to Lord Elwood.</p>
  <p class="prose1">On an elevated platform facing the congregation sat The Regal Council. All five councilmembers were dressed in their usual long, white vestments with embroidered stoles draped around the backs of their necks. Each master’s stole was uniquely adorned with their sect’s floral emblem: lotus flower, blackthorn, foxglove, lily of the valley, and gerbera. Together, they resembled a fertile garden. Or perhaps ‘mimicked’ would be the correct word to use. Flowers are swept by a slight breeze; the Regal Council were unmoving, like corpses.</p>
  <p class="prose1">Atop his wooden throne, made of tangled vines and crooked branches, Lord Elwood waited patiently as the congregation settled down. His eyes, black as midnight, stabbed through the crowd. Camellia once suspected that his eyes could see into a person’s mind. If that was true, she thought, she would have been dealt with the first instance she noticed how crooked his eyes were. Yet, amongst the Disciples she sat, comforted by her Lord’s imperfections.</p>
  <p class="prose1">Three thunderous thumps of Lord Elwood’s sceptre to the ground seized the crowd’s attention. He propped himself upwards as his ivory locs sashayed in the wind. “Blessings to you, servants of Celeste”, he boomed.</p>
  <p class="prose1">“We humbly accept her tender mercies”, the congregation responded in unison.</p>
<p class="prose1">An ear-piercing silence descended into the midst like a thick fog. Camellia held her breath. She could not bear the thought of it shattering the silence which Lord Elwood had so graciously commanded. It would be like treason.</p>
<p class="prose1">Lord Elwood scanned the crowd slowly before marching forwards towards the centre of the stage. “Eager subjects of Celessodhia, a grave sin has been committed by one of our own”, he divulged, bowing his head slightly and concealing his sullen scowl.</p>
<p class="prose1">“O forgive us, Celeste the Merciful!”, the crowd lamented.</p>
<p class="prose1">Lord Elwood’s voice penetrated the riotous noise. “Our forefathers, like today’s transgressor, committed great grievances against Celeste. As punishment for their sins, their air became unbreathable, and their oceans black. Their women became barren, and their meat tasted of bile”. Sister Prunella, presumably moved by the perverse ways of her ancestors, began wailing, her hot tears rendering her a sopping mess. “But our god is merciful, and unlike we mounds of blood and flesh, gives second chances”.</p>
<p class="prose1">“Do we choke on foul-smelling air? Are we poisoned by sullied water? Do our babes weep for honey and milk?”, Lord Elwood asked. Several hundred noes were uttered in response. “This is by the grace of Celeste. Yet, how is her debt repaid?”.
</p>
<p class="prose1">A blanket of silence covered the congregation once again. What crime has been committed this time around, Camellia thought to herself. Fornication? Poaching? Blasphemy?</p>
<p class="prose1">“Theft”, Lord Elwood scoffed, trailing off towards the end as though the mere utterance of the word was sinful enough.</p>
<p class="prose1">The crowd erupted into a herd of feral beasts, bellowing and hammering their feet into the earth.</p>
<p class="prose1">“Treachery!”.</p>
<p class="prose1">“Blood and damnation!”.</p>
<p class="prose1">“How selfish!”, Camellia squealed, joining the horde of aggrieved Celessodhians.</p>
<p class="prose1">“A local boy stole a cockerel from a nearby farm. He stole from us! He plucked meat from the mouths of our young. Snatched food from our old and sickly!”, Lord Elwood stressed. “Are we not satisfied with the blessings Celeste has bestowed upon us?”.</p>
<p class="prose1">“We are eternally grateful!”, the congregation cried, having now morphed into a flock of docile sheep.</p>
<p class="prose1">“We are unworthy of her favour. Yet, she shields us from the purgatory that prevails beyond our walls!”, Lord Elwood howled, his face trembling as he lifted his head up to the skies. “Today, Celeste has once again pardoned us for our sins”. He gestured towards his left, prompting his steward to push a wooden wagon, whose content was concealed beneath a large buckskin, towards the centre of the stage. Lord Elwood seized the covering to reveal what laid underneath.</p>
<p class="prose1">A scrawny, young boy sat upright, his back resting against chopped tree bark. His head, cocked sideways, rested in the palm of his hand. A gnarly smile was plastered across his face, and he appeared to be mid-conversation. Yet, no sound emerged from his motionless body. He was not dead, however. He was under the influence of Piexwood tonic. Three drops of the concoction rendered one’s body limp, and their cheeks swollen, giving the illusion of a theatrical smile. The boy’s posture was so well choreographed that it became easy to overlook the pieces of rope that anchored his body to the wagon. He resembled a child’s plaything. He was inanimate. What was hiding beneath that smile, Camellia wondered? Was he at peace, or were his screams stifled upon contact with his padlocked mouth? Who was he speaking with? A childhood lover? Perhaps the one who he stole the chicken for.</p>
<p class="prose1">“For our bodies are merely vessels enclosing our true essence. With fire, we shall be released from the shackles of bone and flesh and arise to rest in Celeste’s bosom for eternity”, Lord Elwood proclaimed. “This is a great blessing indeed. For this sinner shall reach paradise before us. But fret not! Our day of ascension will come too. Let us rejoice for our brother! May he be welcomed with open arms”.</p>
<p class="prose1">“So shall it be!”, the congregation responded.</p>
<p class="prose1">The steward handed Lord Elwood a flaming torch, which he used to set fire to the wagon. “From Celeste we sprang forth, and to her we shall return”, he recited. Lord Elwood raised his sceptre and pointed it towards the sky.
</p>
<p class="prose1">This was the part of the ceremony that Camellia found unpleasant. When she was still a young girl, Camellia waited for Matron Agnes to walk past her during prayer hour before sneaking her finger onto a lit candle. She could never forget the anguish that her juvenile skin underwent just for a fleeting moment of excitement. She could not imagine how much more painful it would have been if the flame had engulfed her entire body, like it was doing to the young boy sitting before her. He was barely sitting at that point in the ceremony though. His skin had blackened and shrivelled and collapsed. The pieces of rope holding him together had now vanished, and he looked like a lump of unmoulded clay. Or a pile of clay that had been moulded, but then squashed again because the ceramist was disappointed with the outcome.</p>
<p class="prose1">Camellia tried not to pay attention to the flaming corpse in front of her. Whenever she encountered discomfort, she often retreated into the only place she deemed safe enough to unabashedly be herself. In a town like Founder’s Oak, it was difficult to not feel as though several eyes were glued to your every movement. Hence, Camellia treated her mind like an oasis that only she knew how to locate. She felt safe strolling through the gardens of memories and drifting through the meditative springs. For times like these, she had to be cautious travelling to her secret haven. Wandering too deeply into its greenery could make it arduous to escape, and as she was taught in her Disciples’ seminar, “a busy mind breeds corruption”. Camellia was curious about what corrupt weeds could sprout in her oasis, but she considered it too risky to find out.</p>
<p class="prose1">“Arise. Arise. Arise”.</p>
<p class="prose1">The young boy’s essence arose in the form of a grimy smog, leaving behind a mound of ash and bone. Camellia was unsettled by how a person could so quickly turn from a blend of browns and creams and yellows and pinks to a dull jumble of black and grey. What once decorated the earth with colour had now become an ugly blemish. All will be well soon though, Camellia reassured herself. The young boy would join Celeste in the night’s sky, embellishing its darkness with a white glow.
</p>
<p class="prose1">There were no paintings in Founder’s Oak. Such decadent ventures could make the mind run wild. Camellia did not see a need for them really. She lived within a framed painting, colouring the streets with her baby blue robe. Though she once let her curiosity get the better of her in arithmetic class. She would intentionally make blunders on her worksheet and then scribble over the errors in a suspiciously aesthetic manner. Once, her errors formed a misshapen rabbit. A beautifully imperfect rabbit swiftly destroyed when Camellia mistakenly tipped over the ink vial, soiling her robe in black fluid. She was punished that night for being wasteful.</p>
<p class="prose1">Camellia no longer made such trivial mistakes. She reserved her impulses for when she wandered into her oasis. Painting was much easier to do when her eyes were closed. A clean, black canvas for her to deface with pigments of her imagination. She could not do that now. It was mandatory to keep your eyes on the flames.</p>
<p class="prose1">“Arise”.</p>
<p class="prose1">The fire had quenched, and Celeste welcomed another servant into her arms - the third that month. The stench of scorching flesh and stale blood lingered in the air, a generous parting gift from the transgressor.</p>
<p class="prose1">“It is done”, Lord Elwood declared. ‘Until it isn’t’, Camellia added. She wished people would resist temptation so that ascension ceremonies could be avoided entirely, but lately it seemed as though iniquity had become part of the very fabric of Celessodhia. Only two weeks prior, an elderly man ascended after he murdered a stray cat who wandered into his home. Luckily, his ascension was shorter. His sun-dried body was already halfway gone by the time the steward rolled him onto the stage.</p>
<p class="prose1">“Glory to her name”, the congregation chanted.</p>
<p class="prose1">Luminous white beams lit up Lord Elwood’s path as he marched back to his throne, the holes dug by his sceptre into the ground cementing his presence. Dust swept by a warm breeze filled up the holes shortly after each step, like he was never there. His presence was fleeting. Soon, he would be selecting his successor in preparation for his ascent. He must choose one of the Disciples to serve as the next Lord of Celessodhia - the keeper of all truths and the champion of Celeste’s will. Any one of Camellia’s friends or acquaintances could be the next one seated on that wooden throne, setting a fellow Celessodhian ablaze. This was not something Camellia liked to think about.</p>

    <h2 class="title">My White Sutana</h2>
    <p class="prose1">The blinding white of our sutanas survived the yellow aging of the film. Its glow transcends time. It calls out to me, saying “I was with you then, and I am with you now”. </p>
    <p class="prose1">“Smile for Jesus!”, my mother probably said, squatting behind the camera as she beckoned me to look ahead. A quick click of the shutter and then we became angels, frozen in time.</p>
    <p class="prose1">
We were in church. Jesus Reigns Cherubim and Seraphim Church, it is called. We wore white garments every Sunday, but this Sunday was a special one. I can see that from the gold thread woven into our sutanas, and the decorative flowers on the floor, which Sam was so enamoured by. What were we celebrating? I search the photograph for clues to bring this tableau back to life. The thick, orange jumper peeking out from underneath Mary’s sutana lets me know that this picture was taken in one of London’s finger-numbing winters. The scene is clear to me now. The picture is now reborn, a palimpsest of convulsing tambourines, of palm-swelling claps, of naked feet hammering the earth, and of shrill voices crying unto God. I can almost see the lingering sound, now shifting and morphing in my mind.
 </p>
    <p class="prose1">We must have been celebrating our church’s one-year anniversary. We celebrate it every December, so this photo was taken a few months before I turned one. My entrance into this world is intertwined with the birth of Jesus Reigns, the one who came before me. She haunts me like a shadow. At least, this is what I would like to believe. The reality is that I am drowned in her shadow and struggling to come up for air. She suffocates me. I cannot escape her, no matter how hard I try.</p>
    <p class="prose1">“Jesus is watching you!”, my grandmother would say. ‘Jesus Reigns is watching you’, the mantra should have said. I am sure Jesus had bigger things to be worrying about than whether I rolled my eyes at my math teacher whenever he turned his back. But Jesus Reigns was petty. She scoffed at my transgressions and rubbed her perfection in my face. On Sunday, she would remind me of my sins and turn my sutana black. “Follow me”, she would say, causing me to stubbornly turn away from her in rebellion. The next week, I rolled my eyes even harder.
</p>
    <p class="prose1">I tried to forget her during the week, but once I wore that white garment on Sunday, I became a part of her once again. Every year added onto my life was a reminder that she would outlive me.

</p>
    <p class="prose1">With age, I was finally able to cut myself loose.</p>
    <p class="prose1">But now, as I reflect on these memories, frozen in time on this aging film, my heart calls out to her. I yearn for her, and I pray she will return to me. I want to go back to where I was in this photo, small and cuddly and blank-expressioned. I wonder what I was thinking about, and what I would tell myself today. I think I would say, “she never left, and she never will.”  Jesus Reigns is a part of who I am,, but I also exist outside of her.
</p>
<p class="prose1">I am more than just a wingless angel. I am the white space in between the lines, waiting for my story to be written.</p>
