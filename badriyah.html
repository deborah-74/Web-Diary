      <p>Badriyah and the Stolen Pearl is a 3D platformer action-adventure game set in ancient UAE. It follows the story of a 12-year old Emirati girl whose village was invaded by evil jinn who stole the magic pearl that protected her village. After a shocking revelation, she sets out on a journey to recover the stolen pearl and save her village once and for all!</p>
<p>I developed this game alongside two other team members over the course of 4 months as part of a game development incubator organised by Endless Studios. We were granted $12,000 to develop the game after successfully pitching to a team of professionals. My role in the team was as the Lead 3D artist, Level Designer and Creative Director. I modelled the environmental assets such as the traditional Emirati buildings, castles and caves. I also took charge of coding the puzzles and also animating the 3D cut scenes using Unity and Mixamo </p>
